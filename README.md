# POC- Product and Cart back-end server (Microservices with Spring Boot)


# Docker
I have created a Docker-compose file in the main folder where all the microservices folders are located.

Docker is used to containerized all the microservices and run each of it simultaneously after building them as an image through Dockerfile located on each of their respective folders.

Once Docker is installed, run this command on the command prompt (Directory should be on the root folder):

1. Go to the directory where Docker-compose file is located. (It should only be located on the root folder of where the microservice's folders are)
2. COMMAND: docker-compose up --build (This will pull up all the necessary images to use (Databases and Kong), and build images out of executable jar files of each microservices.

Once services are done building with docker, we may now access the API documentations using Swagger and the Kong Gateway manager via "localhost:8002".

# Kong Gateway
Upon accessing it via "localhost:8002", please see attached excel file for the Kong Gateway documentation that I have made which contains all the lists of configured Services, Routes, Plugins, and Consumers that I used.

To secure all the request prior to proxy, I have considerably used Basic Auth Plugin to identify consumers first, their respective group and control their access.

Along with the enabled Basic-Auth plugin, I used as well Access Control List(ACL) plugin for whitelisting consumers by grouping each of it.
I created two consumers, namely 'admin' and 'customer'.  I have configured two groups of consumers, namely 'ADMIN' group and 'CUSTOMER' group. 
1. Admin group- are consumers who are able to access routes with connection to product management like adding Product, Updating product and getting the lists of the products.
2. Customer group - are consumers who are able to access routes with connection to cart services like creating cart upon consuming request, adding item and removing item from the cart.
